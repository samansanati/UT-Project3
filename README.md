# UT-Project3
In this machine learning project, the goal is to develop an effective network intrusion detection system using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The project focuses on applying the techniques and methodologies learned during the course to achieve high performance in classifying network traffic.
UNSW-NB15 is a network intrusion dataset. This dataset is a widely used cybersecurity dataset that contains network traffic data captured in a controlled environment. It contains nine different attacks, including DoS, worms, Backdoor, and Fuzzers. All samples are labeled with one of the nine categories mentioned in the “attack cat” column. The dataset comprises 42 features arranged in columns between the id(first column) and the attack cat(last column). The number of records in the training set is 175,341 and the testing set has 82,332 records from the different types, attack and normal.
